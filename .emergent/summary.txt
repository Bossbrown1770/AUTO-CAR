<analysis>
The previous AI engineer successfully processed the initial application requirements, breaking down the complex task into a structured, phased plan. A key decision was prioritizing payment integration due to its complexity. The engineer effectively engaged the user for clarifications on payment options, social media integration for notifications (specifically Telegram), and details regarding car display for inventory and detail pages. The necessary third-party integration playbooks (Telegram, Stripe) and image assets were acquired. The current state is that all initial requirements and clarifications have been gathered, and the AI engineer is poised to begin the actual code implementation for the full-stack application, focusing on the foundational elements including payment and Telegram integration, and preparing for the UI and admin features.

<product_requirements>
The user requested a fully functional, responsive car dealer website with both frontend and backend (Node.js/Express initially, but implemented with FastAPI/React/MongoDB). Key features include:
- **Pages**: Home, Inventory, Car Details, Contact, About, Login, Register.
- **Admin Page**: Full control over the application, including access management.
- **Payment Page**: Display car summary, customer form, and approximately 5 payment options (Credit Card, Bank, PayPal, plus Telegram). Payments should trigger notifications to the provided social media accounts (Telegram link: , phone: ).
- **Inventory Display**: Basic information with a single car photo.
- **Car Details Page**: Comprehensive details with multiple photos.
- **Security**: All necessary security measures.
- **Hosting**: Ready for hosting.
- **Admin Access**: User will provide a letter for admin access.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Full-stack**: React.js (Frontend), FastAPI (Backend), MongoDB (Database).
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS.
- **Payment**: Stripe Checkout API via .
- **Social Media**: Telegram integration via .
- **Image Handling**: Base-64 format for images on frontend.
- **Environment Management**: Kubernetes container environment, backend                          STARTING

- **API Routing**: Backend routes prefixed with .
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application follows a full-stack architecture with a React frontend and a FastAPI backend, utilizing MongoDB as the database.



-   ****: This will be the main FastAPI application file. It will contain:
    -   API endpoints for car inventory (CRUD).
    -   User authentication and authorization logic (login, register, admin roles).
    -   Payment processing endpoints for Stripe checkout session creation (), status checking (), and webhook handling ().
    -   Integration with  for Stripe and Telegram.
    -   Database models and operations for cars, users, and  collection.
    -   **Changes Made**: Not yet modified, but planned for comprehensive rewrite.
-   ****: Lists all Python dependencies for the FastAPI backend, including , , , , and .
-   ****: Stores backend-specific environment variables like  and .
-   ****: The main React component where the application's routes and primary UI components will be rendered. It will handle:
    -   Routing to different pages (Home, Inventory, Details, Payment, Login, Register, Contact, About).
    -   UI for car display (inventory, details).
    -   Customer forms and payment initiation logic, including polling for payment status.
    -   **Changes Made**: Not yet modified, but planned for comprehensive rewrite.
-   ** / **: These files will contain the global and component-specific styles, heavily utilizing Tailwind CSS for a responsive and modern UI.
-   ****: Manages Node.js and React project dependencies.
-   ****: Stores frontend environment variables, critically  for API calls.
-   ****: This file contains the testing protocol and will be updated with testing results.

The architecture emphasizes clear separation of concerns, environment variable driven configurations, and explicit API routing rules to integrate seamlessly within the Kubernetes environment.

<current_work>
The AI engineer has completed the initial analysis and planning phase for the car dealer website. All explicit user requests have been clarified, including specific payment options, social media integration details (Telegram link and phone), and image display requirements for inventory and detail pages. The comprehensive plan, broken into six phases, has been established, with Payment Integration identified as the hardest part and prioritized. The necessary  playbook for Telegram has been acquired, and relevant car images have been gathered using the . The AI engineer is now fully prepared and is at the point of initiating the actual development work, starting with the core system components, including the backend API for payments and social media notifications, and the initial frontend structure. The next step will involve leveraging  to create the initial versions of , , and  based on the gathered requirements and acquired integration details.
